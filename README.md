  - Adversarial Search (Minimax, Negamax, Expectimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning)  
  - Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)  

- **Decision Making Under Uncertainty**  
  - Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)  
  - Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)  
  - Bandits  

- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  - Q-Learning  
  - Approximate Q-Learning  

- **Bayesian Networks & Probabilistic Reasoning**  

- **Ethics in AI**
